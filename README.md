This is a small experiment to simulate minesweeper boards, and calculate some probabilities over a sample.
One of the goals is to make this efficient enough to be fast and usable for samples of several millions.

The idea came from [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTnelZkjB68) about minesweepers oddities.
